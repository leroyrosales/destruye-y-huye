        East: Sun - Rise AR Intervention is an augmented reality platform that
        uses archival photographic material and a web-based application to plot
        markers over the neighborhoods of East Austin. The physical markers (ie.
        a corner street, a parade on the streets; a sidewalk that is getting
        some public work; a public swimming pool, a baseball or a football
        field, or an iconic moon tower light, etc) reconcile within the public
        spaces while trace in a virtual and a physical tour-like experience
        relates to origin, history and labor.

        East: Sun - Rise ARI blurs notions of art in public places by layering
        virtually archival material within the use of Global Positioning System
        (GPS) to geo-locate photographs in public places, in which the main
        protagonists of the photographs, BIPOC - Black, Indigenous, and People
        of Color, that are documented celebrating life, playing sports, having a
        parade, demonstrating, standing outside of a school or just having a
        walk in the neighborhood, brought us in time and made us here
        assimilating a time the has passed with such a rich stories and
        anecdotes from the people who originated this part of town.
