In the 1950s, states, municipalities, and school districts throughout the southern United States scrambled to assemble new African American schools which will show they provided “separate but equal” segregated schools. African American public schooling had lengthy been disregarded withinside the South in choose of funding white schools, however because the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Black students began winning instances withinside the courts for equalization or desegregation, Southern politicians finally turned their interest to equalizing number one and secondary public school systems. In 1950, Austin, Texas had one white high school (Austin High) and one Black high school (L.C. Anderson High). In order to preserve the schools segregated, Austin school officials, in 1953, sought to “equalize” Anderson with a new, cutting-edge constructing that had greater classrooms, science laboratory space, an up to date heating system, and athletic fields for the duration of the middle of school equalization and desegregation lawsuits. However, the Austin Public School system desegregated beneath neath a “freedom of choice” plan in 1955, and Black students started out attending previously all-white schools. Today, the building sits on a hill in East Austin as a physical example of the city’s efforts to equalize its segregated school system. Ultimately that effort failed, and a robust African American community center was misplaced to persisted discrimination while trying school system integration.

African American public school education in the South has roots in the Freedmen’s Bureau established after the Civil War to educate millions of former slaves. Despite a short experiment with included schools at some point of Reconstruction and the landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education desegregation decision, the substantial majority of southern schools remained segregated via way of means of race until the 1970s. The African American schools served as facilities in their community, supplied employment and management possibilities for Black citizens, and showcased pride in Black student achievements. Institutional racism as practiced via way of means of white politicians and school board participants supposed that Black schools usually acquired the least amount of investment and were regularly the first to close to achieve a measure of racial integration. Only below chance of desegregation proceedings did the white power structure of the South ever invest money in its public school system.

L.C. Anderson High School in Austin, Texas, serves as a case study for community cohesion and pride in the face of institutional racism. Austin’s only Black high school is rooted in the 1880s. While the school continually suffered from unequal funding and investment, it was upgraded in 1953 in an attempt to forestall any desegregation lawsuits in Austin. This new school building provided amenities like a gymnasium, athletic fields, and specialized classrooms for the first time, but quickly became overcrowded. Ultimately, the new Anderson High School was only open less than 20 years, as the Austin Independent School District (AISD) chose to close the high school in 1971 and bus its students to local white high schools to attain integration. Similar erasures of long-standing African American institutions occurred across the South.

Despite being constructed in the South during the Jim Crow era, Anderson High and Yellow Jacket Stadium quickly became celebrated. Perhaps most noteworthy was Anderson’s football team, which produced NFL players and earned state championships and drew visits from football legends like Darrell Royal. More than 8,000 people were in attendance when the team won its 1957 state title. The old Anderson High School building sits atop a small hill at 900 Thompson street in East Austin, east of Pleasant Valley road.
