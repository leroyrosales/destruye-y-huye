In the mixture of boys and girls, most students are exiting the building after school, while a few stand and talk to each other. One girl sits on the wall and reads from a notebook. The girls all wear long skirts, blouses, white socks and black shoes. The boys wears slacks and shirts, and one wears a jacket.'
