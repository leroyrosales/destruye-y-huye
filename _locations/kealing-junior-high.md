Kealing Junior High School opened in the fall of 1930 as the first junior high school for African-American students in Austin and named posthumously for Hightower Theodore Kealing (1859-1918), an African-American educator, writer, editor and activist in Austin in the 19th century. The first principal was Professor I.Q. Hurdle, who served from 1930 to 1939. When enrollment increased, the school expanded into the former Anderson High School in 1954. The two buildings, known as East Kealing and West Kealing, were joined in 1962.  Principal T.C. Calhoun then led Kealing until 1971, when the school was closed as part of Austin’s desegregation efforts, the school was closed in 1971 due to court-ordered desegregation.

After serving as an annex for the Austin Independent School District (AISD) and community programs, Kealing’s building was devastated by fire.
The original Kealing Junior High School building was razed in 1983, and the old Anderson High School on this site burned in 1984. A new Kealing Junior High was built and opened in 1986. In 1986, the school reopened as a junior high school, both for students in the Kealing neighborhood and for students throughout AISD who were accepted into its rigorous and innovative academic magnet math and science program. In 1993, the magnet program expanded to include a focus on the liberal arts as well. In the fall of 2004, Kealing opened its sixth grade program and became a middle school.
